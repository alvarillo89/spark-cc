# Big Data with Spark on Cloud Platforms
###### Developed for the Cloud Computing subject of the master's degree in computer engineering

In the development of this practice, different methods and techniques of data processing will be 
studied and used for large volumes of data (Big Data). In particular, the final objective will be to solve 
a problem of classification through the development of different models, using Spark, Hadoop and MLLib.
